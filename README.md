# Avail
Avail Node Client
Avail is a general-purpose, scalable data availability-focused blockchain targeted for standalone chains, sidechains, and off-chain scaling solutions.

Avail provides a robust data availability layer by using an extremely secure mathematical primitive — data availability checks using erasure codes with a key innovation — Avail uses KZG polynomial commitments to create a 2D data availability scheme that avoids fraud proofs, does not require honest majority assumptions, and has no reliance on honest full node peer to gain confidence that the data is available.
